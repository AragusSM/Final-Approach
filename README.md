# FINAL APPROACH VR DESIGN DOCUMENT
## Purpose
This was our final project for our VR Development for Games class in the spring of 2023. Our team members consisted of Danny Bernal, [Neal Davar](https://nealdavar.com), Austin Nguyen, Davie Nguyen, [Michael Ning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ning-b495b3209/), [Anand Valavalkar](https://www.anandvalavalkar.com). 

## Overview
The player is an air traffic controller responsible for managing an airport's airplane takeoffs and landings. The player is in a control tower with monitors and controls allowing them to view and control arriving and departing planes. The player must manage the plane's resources and runway timers without causing airplane collisions and prioritizing on time arrivals and departures. The player’s goal is to manage the airplanes' takeoffs and landings efficiently without collisions, and allow the highest number of ontime arrivals and departures. In addition, the fuel level of the planes will allow for higher points to be scored at the end. Planes landed or taken off can also be scored according to the priority of the flights.

## Realism
In Final Approach VR, we have gone above and beyond to deliver an unmatched level of authenticity by ensuring that each 3D model of the planes in our simulator corresponds to actual real-life flights taken within the last 30 days. We have meticulously gathered and integrated data from various aviation sources, encompassing details such as the correct destination, flight number, IATA and ICAO codes, as well as the specific plane models. This painstaking attention to detail allows players to interact with a living, breathing virtual airspace, closely mirroring the dynamic nature of real-world air traffic.

By incorporating real-life flight data into our game, we provide an immersive and educational experience that simulates the genuine challenges faced by air traffic controllers. Players have the opportunity to manage diverse aircraft models, ranging from small propeller planes to massive commercial airliners, each with their unique handling characteristics and operational requirements. 

To further enhance the authenticity of our game, we integrated accurate 3D rendering of a real airport and control tower. Players can expect to experience realistic audio and visual cues, as well as the intense decision-making processes that air traffic controllers face daily. The result is an unparalleled VR experience that not only entertains but also educates users about the complexities and challenges of air traffic control.

## Ideation Phase
We came up with our idea from listing themes we were individually interested in. Aviation came up as one of the interests and we ultimately voted on it as our theme which evolved into air traffic control.

We also considered the ideas of wave based survival games (wizards and magic, bloons tower defense) as well as matching/pattern games (objective matching manufacturing game, DJ simulator).

## Playtest Feedback
Our playtest yielded some very good feedback, from both the TA and from fellow students. One of the main pieces of feedback concerned the clarity of the instructions and gameplay. Some of the playtesters were initially confused about how to play the game and also what the overall point of the game was, at least prior to one of the developer’s verbal guidance. We did also receive a lot of positive feedback; playtesters were impressed with the graphics and being able to see their actions translate to actual planes taking off and arriving. With this game being somewhat of a puzzle-type/strategy game, playtesters said they were excited to test their brain power. 

Changes that we made in response to this feedback, was to add an instruction screen/page that players can read before clicking start.This should be a comprehensive tutorial video that plays before starting and will have coinciding, clear text.

## Narrative Design
There is not much of a story, but more of a simulation. Let’s say that an individual would like to one day become an air traffic controller; our game could function as a method for that individual to simulate what it's like to manage planes in a virtual scenario whilst under a similar, albeit on a completely different scale, stressful environment. 

Since there is not really a storyline per se, our game is much more about discovery and animations. The user’s goal is to manage planes, based on given information (ie. fuel levels, time of arrivals, time of departures), to safely reach their destinations with punctuality. Animations are apparent when users signal for takeoff or arrival, which enhance the user’s experience as an air traffic controller.

## Gameplay and Mechanics
Once the user selects a level and clicks the starting button, a series of flights will appear on the dashboard monitor, each with certain stats. Planes must be optimally assigned to runways in order to maximize the points earned. Planes that pass a waiting time will earn no points while a plane that loses its fuel while in the air instantly causes the player to lose the game. The goal is to get as many points to advance to the next level, where the game will become more complex with the addition of runways and airplane types.

Our game includes a few mechanics that are quite apparent as a user attempts to achieve victory and get the highest score. Users can click/push buttons on the console, swipe through a menu of planes, grab door handles to enter and exit the tower and teleport (via ray-induced click) throughout the environment. Also included are additional scenes that allow the user to navigate through the airport using a vehicle such as a car or firetruck.

## Aesthetic Style
Our Aesthetics mostly feature a modern - futuristic Air traffic control scene. The actual gameplay UI is a sort of hologram panel projection where the user can interact using ray cast.The Air traffic control center features an area with many monitors and computers, representative of what a real ATC would look like (sort of).



Our Airport is modeled after a real airport in Germany, which is where we built most of our environment from. We then obtained our planes from a realistic planes asset pack. Since our game is designed to be more of a simulation, our goal was to make the process seem as realistic as possible while still having feasible and intuitive player interactions.
