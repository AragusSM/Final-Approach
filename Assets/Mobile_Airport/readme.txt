The runway and taxiways lights will be created dynamic at runtime.
To switch different modes the the lights for each runway, just select 
the object "RunwayTaxiwayLights" and set the values per runway
as you like. 
You can also change these values from other scripts at runtime.

If you want to change the view distance of the runway lights,
change the value at bottom of the "RunwayTaxiwayLights" object.
All of them are names ....MaxViewDistance
